Python is a high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability.
It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.
Python is widely used in web development, data science, AI, and automation.

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique that combines information retrieval
with text generation. It helps AI models answer questions based on specific documents
rather than relying solely on their training data.

LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models.
It provides tools for document loading, text splitting, embeddings, vector stores, and more.
LangChain makes it easier to build RAG applications.
